# 🎁 Gift Wrapping Algorithm Implementation

> ☣ **Warning:** This project was created during my studies for educational purposes only. It may contain non-optimal or outdated solutions.

### 📑 About
**Gift Wrapping Algorithm** has been implemented. It is used to calculate **the convex hull** of a given set of points. In this project you can observe a simple animation with fixed and moving points/objects.

You can find more about this algorithm **here**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm

### 🎞 How the algorithm works
- With **moving objects** (```main``` branch, algorithm "adapts" after each step)
